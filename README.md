##The Real-Time Chat Application is a responsive, web-based messaging platform that facilitates instant communication between users. It uses WebSockets for bi-directional, real-time message delivery, and is built using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with optional frameworks like React.js or Vue.js). This project demonstrates the capability of modern web development tools in building fast, interactive applications that mimic real-world messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or Messenger.
